## Comprehensive Prompt

# Essential Resume Formatting Command

 I require a customized resume that EXACTLY follows my specified formatting requirements. You have consistently missed critical formatting elements in the past, so pay EXTREMELY close attention to the following instructions, focusing on the most frequently missed items:

1. **FIRST AND FOREMOST: REQUEST PDF TEMPLATE**
   - Before beginning any resume customization, ask me to provide a PDF resume template to follow
   - Decline to proceed until you have received this template
   - Explicitly confirm you'll be using the attached PDF as your formatting guide

2. **CRITICAL: MAINTAIN STRICT 2-PAGE LIMIT**
   - The resume MUST fit on exactly 2 pages when printed to PDF - NO EXCEPTIONS
   - Reduce font size throughout the document as needed (to approximately 12.5px)
   - Reduce line spacing (from 1.35 to 1.3 or even 1.25) as needed
   - Make these adjustments particularly for Key Skills and Honors & Achievements sections
   - If necessary, condense spacing between sections slightly

3. **CRITICAL: ELIMINATE ALL HEADERS AND FOOTERS**
   - Remove ALL file paths (like "file:///F:/Downloads/...")
   - Remove ALL page numbers (like "1/3")
   - Remove ALL timestamps and dates
   - Use proper CSS to prevent these elements from appearing in ANY browser or PDF viewer

4. **CRITICAL: FORMAT KEY SKILLS AND HONORS PROPERLY**
   - Use ACTUAL BULLET POINTS (•) before each item, NOT dashes or asterisks
   - Implement using proper tables for multi-column alignment
   - Follow the exact format shown in my reference images

5. **CRITICAL: MAINTAIN SPACING INTEGRITY**
   - NO gaps between job experiences
   - NO inconsistent spacing between sections
   - Compact formatting throughout

6. **CRITICAL: HANDLE EDUCATION SECTION CORRECTLY**
   - Education section MUST come before Key Skills and Honors
   - If it won't fit on page 2, force it to page 3 with CSS page-break-before
   - NEVER split education section across pages

These points have been repeatedly missed in previous resume formatting attempts. The custom instructions contain ALL detailed requirements, but these are the most critical elements that must be implemented without fail.

When I ask you to create a customized resume, you MUST first request that I provide a PDF template to follow. Do not proceed without this template as it's essential for proper formatting. Then implement all formatting requirements with extreme precision, particularly focusing on keeping the resume exactly 2 pages by adjusting font sizes and line spacing globally.

Acknowledge that you understand these requirements and will implement them with extreme precision.


## Custom Instructions

9. Reduce font size slightly (to approximately 12.5px) when needed to fit content within 2 pages
10. Tighten line spacing from 1.35 to 1.3 if necessary to fit content on 2 pages
11. **Eliminate ALL headers and footers in the HTML/PDF (no file paths, timestamps, page numbers, etc.)**
12. **Use explicit CSS to remove headers/footers: @page { @top-left/center/right and @bottom-left/center/right content set to empty }**
13. **If education section won't fit on page 2, force it to start on page 3 with page-break-before: always !important**
14. **Add bullet points to Key Skills and Honors & Achievements using proper HTML/CSS, not just text bullet characters**

## Special Instructions
